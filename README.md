# MTA_timer

###Project was completed for midterm assignment at NYU's Tandon Graduate Program

We all always complain about the inefficiency of the NYC MTA. The F train, commonly known as the "forever" train is perpetually 8 minute delayed and Herald Square seems to have a power outage every other week. It should be no surprise that the MTA's API is a pain and a half to use.

##Step I
I used this API through node.js. I install node.js through homebrew locally on my machine. (On a side note, using homebrew on the new M1 Macs can be tricky because everything is not M1 compatible  right now.)
I followed this node.js documentation found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
If you do not already have P5.js installed locally, you will need to install that as well.

##Step 2
I have a wonderful professor, Jiwon Shin,  who took on the brunt of configuring the API to load the data through node.js. She created a basic sketch that used a socket to fetch the data. Her starter code in found here. This is an awesome place to start if you are not interested in my cleaned and sifted through subway data. 
Jiwon's starter code is found here: https://github.com/js6450/mta-to-p5.js
